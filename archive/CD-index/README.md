# CD Index calculations

The notebooks in this folder present a method to compute the CD index via a short SQL query on Dimensions on Google BigQuery. This approach makes it possible to calculate e.g. CD5 index for all journal articles with references in Dimensions in less than 5 hours.

**Note** 

These notebooks are supplementary materials to the paper (soon to be released):
