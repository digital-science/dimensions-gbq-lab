# Archive: Events and Demos Notebooks

This folder contains customized versions of the tutorials included in the [BigQuery Lab website](https://bigquery-lab.dimensions.ai/), used for workshops, hackdays or focusing on a specific institution or audience. 

**Note** 
The notebooks in this folder are simply *archived* for future reference and are not normally tested afterwards. 

See also the [mkdocs/src-docs/queries](https://github.com/digital-science/dimensions-gbq-lab/tree/main/mkdocs/src-docs/queries) folder for more SQL queries source code.
