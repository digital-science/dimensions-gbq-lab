The source code of the queries and further explanations are available in the [Queries](../queries/index.md) section.


!!! note 
    New queries and collections are added frequently, so watch this space or keep an eye on the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/digital-science/dimensions-gbq-lab/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file on Github!
