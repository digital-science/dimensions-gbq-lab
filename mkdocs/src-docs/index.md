# Welcome to the Dimensions BigQuery Lab!

This site and its related [Github repository](https://github.com/digital-science/dimensions-gbq-lab) contain a collection of tutorials and queries showing how to carry out common research data analytics tasks using the [Dimensions database on Google BigQuery](https://www.dimensions.ai/products/bigquery/) (GBQ).

!!! note "Note"
    Dimensions is a comprehensive database for the research & innovation ecosystem, used by governments, universities, businesses, funders and investors around the world. It is a structured, linked database containing trillions of data points about the research landscape, organized in tables e.g. research organizations, publications, patents, grants, clinical trials and more.

You can use the structured code examples on this site to put together analyses for specific use cases e.g.

* Competitive intelligence
* Horizon-scanning & emerging trends
* Academic & industry partnerships and collaboration networks
* Key Opinion Leader (KOL) identification
* Recruitment & talent
* Performance & benchmarking
* Tracking funding dollar flows and citation patterns
* Social and economic impact of research

## How to use this Lab

The Lab is designed for learning and inspiration. It demonstrates how to query BigQuery according to best practices, how to work with the Dimensions data structure, and how to do core analytical tasks. As you become more experienced with the data, you will want to combine these building blocks into more complex analyses that answer your business or research questions.

The materials in this Lab can be navigated sequentially, or you can use the search box above to enter a keyword and see matching documents.

There are three main sections:

* The **Tutorials** section contains guides that focus on specific topics or use cases e.g. how to deal with a specific data type, or how to use GBQ in combination with other technologies.
* The **Collections** section contains thematic groupings of queries based on application scenarios (e.g. citation analysis).
* The **Queries** section is an archive of reusable SQL queries together with an explanation of what they do.
