# 1. Number of publications added to Dimensions each month

!!! success "Level: Easy"
    This query is suitable for new users of Dimensions on Google BigQuery


## Description

Counts the number of publications added to Dimensions each month, using the `date_inserted` field.

## Query

```sql
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC(date_inserted, MONTH) as date,
  COUNT(id) as countDim
FROM
  `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications`
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 5
```

### Breaking it down

The [DATETIME_TRUNC](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/functions-and-operators#datetime_trunc) function is used here to "round down" the timestamps in the `date_inserted` field to the month level.


## Results

```json

  {
    "date": "2021-04-01 00:00:00 UTC",
    "countDim": "458175"
