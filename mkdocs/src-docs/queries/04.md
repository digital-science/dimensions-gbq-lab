# 4. Generate a list of publication categories by flattening/concatenating nested data

!!! info "Level: Medium"
    This query requires basic knowledge of SQL and the Dimensions data model

## Description

This query returns a table with a single row. One field contains the Dimensions publication ID, and the other contains a string of all categories associated with the publication, separated by semicolons. 

It's very similar to the [publication authors query](03.md). You may also be interested in [the tutorial about working with nested fields](../tutorials/04-nested.md).

## Query

```sql
WITH categories AS (
  SELECT
    id,
    ARRAY(
        SELECT name
        FROM UNNEST(category_for.first_level.FULL)
    ) AS category_names
  FROM
    `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications`
  WHERE
    id = 'pub.1132070778'
)

SELECT
  id,
  ARRAY_TO_STRING(category_names, '; ') AS categories_list
FROM categories
```

## Results

```json
[
  {
    "id": "pub.1132070778",
    "categories_list": "Physical Sciences; Chemical Sciences"
  }
]
```
