# 5. Number of publications per SDG category

!!! success "Level: Easy"
    This query is suitable for new users of Dimensions on Google BigQuery

## Description

Many publications in the Dimensions database are classified under [Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://dimensions.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/23000018820). 

This query returns the top five most commonly applied SDG classifications and the total number of publications in each one.

## Query

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(p.id) AS tot,
  sdg.name
FROM `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications` p
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(category_sdg.full) sdg
GROUP BY
  sdg.name
ORDER BY
  tot DESC
LIMIT 5
```

### Breaking it down

This query is short but wades through a complex data structure. While the [author names query](03.md) has to deal with an array of structs, this one has to parse *a struct of arrays*: Refer to the [schema documentation](https://docs.dimensions.ai/bigquery/datasource-publications.html) for the details, but if we want to access the names of the SDG categories relevant to a single publication, we have to drill through multiple layers:

1. The `publications` table uses a single row to represent a single publication.
1. Publications with an SDG categorization have a struct in the `category_sdg` field with two keys: `codes` and `full`.
1. We can access this by name, so `category_sdg.full` will give us the relevant entry for a publication. However, `category_sdg.full` is an **array**.
1. Each entry in the `category_sdg.full` array is another struct, with three fields: `code`, `id` and `name`. **We want the names.**

We can get through the first struct by getting the `full` field by name. From there, we need to do something more complex:
```sql
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(category_sdg.full) sdg
```

This line performs [a *cross join*](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#cross_join). The less-technical explanation for what happens here is that, since `category_sdg.full` is an array, using a cross join with the publications table creates a new field called `sdg`, and each row of the `publications` table is repeated, **once for each value for `sdg`.** A quick demonstration:

**WITHOUT UNNEST()**:

| id          | category_sdg.full       |
| ----------- | ------------------------|
| pub.123     | sdg1, sdg2, sdg3        |
| pub.987     | sdg4, sdg1              |

**WITH UNNEST()**:

| id          | sdg       |
| ----------- | ----------|
| pub.123     | sdg1      |
| pub.123     | sdg2      |
| pub.123     | sdg3      |
| pub.987     | sdg4      |
| pub.987     | sdg1      |

So after this clause:
```sql
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(category_sdg.full) sdg
```
we have a new field, `sdg`, that has the nested fields [associated with an individual SDG](https://docs.dimensions.ai/bigquery/datasource-publications.html#publications-systematiccategory): `code`, `id` and `name`. Since we want `name`, that's what we refer to in the final query:

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(p.id) AS tot,
  sdg.name
FROM `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications` p
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(category_sdg.full) sdg
GROUP BY
  sdg.name
ORDER BY
  tot DESC
LIMIT 5
```

We then count the number of IDs associated with each SDG `name` by using a `GROUP BY` clause.

## Results

```json
[
  {
    "tot": "1577950",
    "name": "Affordable and Clean Energy"
  },
  {
    "tot": "1455575",
    "name": "Good Health and Well Being"
  },
  {
    "tot": "769875",
    "name": "Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"
  },
  {
    "tot": "633369",
    "name": "Quality Education"
  },
  {
    "tot": "507003",
    "name": "Climate Action"
  }
]
