# 6. Publications count per FoR category, total and percentage against total

!!! warning "Level: Advanced"
    This query requires a good understanding of SQL and the Dimensions data model

## Description

Many publications in the Dimensions database are classified under [ANZSRC Field of Research codes](https://dimensions.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/23000018820). 

This query returns the total number of publications classified under each, plus the percentage of all publications in Dimensions with that classification.

## Query

```sql
SELECT
  cat.name,
  COUNT(p.id) AS pubs_global,
  ROUND(
    (
      COUNT(p.id) * 100 /(
        SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications`
      )
    ), 2
  ) AS pubs_global_pc
FROM
  `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications` p,
  UNNEST(category_for.first_level.full) cat
GROUP BY
  cat.name
ORDER BY
  pubs_global_pc DESC,
  cat.name
```

### Breaking it down

This query looks more complicated than it is. The main component could be summarized using this query:

```sql
SELECT
  cat.name,
  COUNT(p.id) AS pubs_global
FROM
  `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications` p,
  UNNEST(category_for.first_level.full) cat
GROUP BY
  cat.name
```

This query works exactly like [the "publications per SDG" query](05.md), and there's a full breakdown there explaining how we unnest structs full of arrays full of structs. The main take-away is that we extract the names of all the first-level FOR codes, then count the number of publications listed under each one. That leaves only one more SELECT statement:

```sql
ROUND(
    (
      COUNT(p.id) * 100 /(
        SELECT COUNT(*)
        FROM `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications`
      )
    ), 2
  ) AS pubs_global_pc
```

This piece of the query just counts how many total records are in the `publications` table:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications`
```

And this next piece of the query takes the total number of publications in a single classification and divides it by that total. The `* 100` piece converts the decimal into a percentage:
```sql
COUNT(p.id) * 100 /(
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications`
)
```

The outer-most call, to the `ROUND()` function, states that the function should return the percentage rounded to two decimal places.
