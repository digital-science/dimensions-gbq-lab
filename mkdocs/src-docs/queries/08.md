# 8. Finding articles matching a specific affiliation string

!!! info "Level: Medium"
    This query requires basic knowledge of SQL and the Dimensions data model

## Description

This query returns a list of publications and affiliations associated with a single institution. Each line represents a single affiliation string, and includes the publication ID, the institution ID, and the affiliation string as reported by the journal. 

Results are filtered to include only a single institution, specified by GRID ID ([grid.69566.3a](https://www.grid.ac/institutes/grid.69566.3a)), and affiliation strings that include the phrase `"school of medicine"`.  **For more details about working with nested fields, see [the tutorial page on the topic](../tutorials/04-nested.md).**

SELECT
  p.id,
  aff.grid_id,
  aff.raw_affiliation
FROM
  `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications` p
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(authors) auth
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(auth.affiliations_address) aff
WHERE
  year = 2020
  AND aff.grid_id = "grid.69566.3a" -- Sendai, Japan
  AND LOWER(aff.raw_affiliation) LIKE "%school of medicine%"
