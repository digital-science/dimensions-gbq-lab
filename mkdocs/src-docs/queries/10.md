# 10. Select publications matching selected concepts

!!! info "Level: Medium"
    This query requires basic knowledge of SQL and the Dimensions data model


## Description

This query counts the number of publications about a set of tropical diseases. It filters publications by selecting only those that either refer to those diseases in the title, or that have been tagged with those diseases as [concepts](https://docs.dimensions.ai/dsl/language.html#searching-using-concepts) within the Dimensions database.

Once publications have been found, the counts are broken down both by year and by publisher; the final list shows the top 10 publisher-years in which the most papers were published about those diseases.

## Query

```sql
SELECT
  publisher.NAME AS publisher,
  year,
  COUNT(*) AS num_pub
FROM
  `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications`,
  UNNEST(concepts) c
WHERE
  (LOWER(c.concept) IN UNNEST(["buruli ulcer", "mycobacterium", "mycolactone", "bairnsdale ulcer"])
    OR REGEXP_CONTAINS(title.preferred, r"(?i)/buruli ulcer|mycobacterium|mycolactone|bairnsdale ulcer/"))
  AND year >= 2010
  AND publisher IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
  publisher,
  year
ORDER BY
  num_pub DESC,
  year,
  publisher
LIMIT 10
```
