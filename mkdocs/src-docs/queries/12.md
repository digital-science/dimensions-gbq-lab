# 12. Counting new vs recurring authors, for a specific journal

!!! warning "Level: Advanced"
    This query requires a good understanding of SQL and the Dimensions data model


## Description

This query evaluates a single journal (specified by journal ID - e.g. [jour.1115214](https://app.dimensions.ai/discover/publication?and_facet_source_title=jour.1115214)) and counts the number of authors per year that it has published. Authors are split into two categories: new authors who have never appeared in the journal before, and "recurring" authors who have already written at least one previous article in the journal.

!!! note "Note"
    Because the query starts in 2011, some "recurring" authors *are never counted as new authors*: If an author publishes one paper each in, say, 2007 and 2014, they will appear as a recurring author in 2014, but the year in which they would be a "new" author is not displayed.

## Query

```sql
WITH authoryear AS (
  -- how many papers has each individual researcher published in
  -- the specified journal? Broken down by year.
  SELECT
    pubs.year,
    author.researcher_id,
    COUNT(pubs.id) AS numpubs
  FROM
    `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications` AS pubs
  CROSS JOIN UNNEST(pubs.authors) AS author
  WHERE
    author.researcher_id IS NOT NULL
    AND journal.id="jour.1115214" -- Nature BioTechnology
  GROUP BY
    author.researcher_id, pubs.year
),
authorfirst AS (
  -- For each author, what year is their FIRST publication in
  -- the specified journal?
  SELECT researcher_id, MIN(year) AS minyear
  FROM authoryear
  GROUP BY researcher_id
),
authorsummary AS (
  -- Modify the author-level list of publications per
  -- year by adding a new field, "firstyear", that indicates
  -- whether this is the year in which they are "new."
  SELECT
    ay.*,
    IF(ay.year=af.minyear, TRUE, FALSE) AS firstyear
  FROM authoryear ay
  INNER JOIN authorfirst af
    ON af.researcher_id=ay.researcher_id
),
numauthors AS (
  -- For each year, total up the new and recurring authors
  SELECT year, firstyear,
    COUNT(DISTINCT researcher_id) AS numresearchers
  FROM authorsummary
  WHERE year>2010
  GROUP BY year, firstyear
)

-- Finally, we rearrange the "numauthors" subquery so
-- each year in the specified range only has a SINGLE ROW,
-- indicating both the new and recurring authors.
SELECT
  year,
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN firstyear
        THEN numresearchers
      ELSE 0
    END
  ) AS num_first,
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN NOT firstyear
        THEN numresearchers
      ELSE 0
    END
  ) AS num_recurring
FROM numauthors
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year
```
