# 15. Top N publications by citations percentile

!!! warning "Level: Advanced"
    This query requires a good understanding of SQL and the Dimensions data model

## Description

This query sorts all engineering publications from 2020 by their total citations and returns those in the top 1%. 

Engineering publications are determined by evaluating [Field of Research classifications](https://plus.dimensions.ai/support/solutions/articles/23000018826-what-is-the-background-behind-the-fields-of-research-for-classification-system-) that are applied to the publications. `"09"` is the top-level code [assigned to "Engineering."](https://app.dimensions.ai/browse/categories/publication/for)

## Query

```sql
WITH pubs AS (
  SELECT
    p.id as id,
    p.title.preferred as title,
    p.citations_count as citations,
  FROM
    `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications` p
  WHERE
    year = 2020
    AND "09" IN UNNEST(category_for.first_level.codes)
),
ranked_pubs AS (
  SELECT
    p.*,
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY p.citations DESC) citation_percentile
  FROM
    pubs p
)

SELECT * FROM ranked_pubs
WHERE
  citation_percentile <= 0.01
ORDER BY
  citation_percentile ASC
```
