# 17. One-degree citation network for a single publication

!!! warning "Level: Advanced"
    This query requires a good understanding of SQL and the Dimensions data model

## Description

This query generates a basic (incoming) citation network for a single publication (the "root node"). 

"Level 1" publications in the query are publications that are citing the root publication. "Level 2" publications are citing Level 1 publications. Each row describes a vertex in the network and what year the citation occurred.

## Query

```sql
WITH level1 AS (
  SELECT "pub.1099396382" as citation_from, citations.id AS citation_to,
    1 AS level, citations.year as citation_year
  FROM `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications` p
    CROSS JOIN UNNEST(citations) AS citations
  WHERE p.id="pub.1099396382" -- starting node defined here
),

level2 AS (
  SELECT l.citation_to AS citation_from, citations.id AS citation_to,
    2 AS level, citations.year AS citation_year
  FROM `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications` p
    CROSS JOIN UNNEST(citations) as citations, level1 l
  where p.id = l.citation_to
)

SELECT * from level1
UNION ALL
SELECT * from level2
```

## 17.1 Variant: one-degree references network for a single publication

We could use the same approach in order to build a references network (=outgoing citations). 

This can be achieved via the publications field `references_ids`. 


```sql
WITH level1 AS (
  SELECT "pub.1099396382" as references_from, reference AS reference_to,
    1 AS level
  FROM `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications` p
    CROSS JOIN UNNEST(reference_ids) AS reference
  WHERE p.id="pub.1099396382" -- starting node defined here
),

level2 AS (
  SELECT l.reference_to AS reference_from, reference AS reference_to,
    2 AS level
  FROM `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications` p
    CROSS JOIN UNNEST(reference_ids) as reference, level1 l
  where p.id = l.reference_to
)

SELECT * from level1
UNION ALL
SELECT * from level2
```
