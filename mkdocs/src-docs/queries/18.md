# 18. Incoming citations for a journal

!!! info "Level: Medium"
    This query requires basic knowledge of SQL and the Dimensions data model

## Description

This query lists incoming citations per year for a single journal. Results are split out by year *and* by the [type of publication](https://plus.dimensions.ai/support/solutions/articles/23000018866-which-publication-types-are-available-in-dimensions-) that cited the journal (article, book, etc).

!!! note "Note"
    There is an important clause in the `SELECT` statement that changes the behavior of this query: If you use `COUNT(DISTINCT id)`, the query counts *unique publications* that cited the selected journal. If you use `COUNT(id)` instead, this counts *citations*: If one publication cites multiple papers from a single journal, the latter query will count each citation separately.

## Query

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS totcount,  year, type
FROM
  `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications`
WHERE
  id IN (
    SELECT citing_pubs.id
    FROM
      `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications`,
      UNNEST(citations) AS citing_pubs
    WHERE journal.id = "jour.1115214" -- Nature Biotechnology
  )
  AND year >= 2005
GROUP BY year, type
ORDER BY year, type
```
