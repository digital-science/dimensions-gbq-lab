# 19. Outgoing citations from a journal

!!! info "Level: Medium"
    This query requires basic knowledge of SQL and the Dimensions data model

## Description

This query counts outgoing citations per year from a single journal. Results are broken down by year and by the [type of publication](https://plus.dimensions.ai/support/solutions/articles/23000018866-which-publication-types-are-available-in-dimensions-) being cited (article, book, etc).

!!! note "Note"
    There is an important clause in the `SELECT` statement that changes the behavior of this query: If you use `COUNT(DISTINCT id)`, the query counts *unique publications* that have been cited in the selected journal. If you use `COUNT(id)` instead, this counts *citations*: If one publication it cited by multiple papers in a single journal, the latter query will count each citation separately.

## Query

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT id) AS totcount,  year, type
FROM
  `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications`
WHERE
  id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT reference_pubs
    FROM
      `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications`,
      UNNEST(reference_ids) AS reference_pubs
    WHERE journal.id = "jour.1115214" -- Nature Biotechnology
  )
  AND year >= 2005
GROUP BY year, type
ORDER BY year, type
```
