# 21. International collaboration rate of individuals, with context

!!! warning "Level: Advanced"
    This query requires a good understanding of SQL and the Dimensions data model


## Description

This query determines the yearly proportion of publications from a single author that include international collaborators. It also calculates the same rate for the author's current institution (for papers in the same field), and the author's current country. A few highlights:

* We can simplify the query by collecting all the author-specific data up front, in the `researcher_details` and `researcher_field` subqueries, and referring to it later simply as something like `(SELECT org FROM researcher_details)`.
* When we calculate the percentage of papers that are international collaborations, it would be much simpler to simply write `(intl*100) / (intl + domestic)`. However, in situations where there are zero papers returned for that particular category, this will return an error because the query would call for dividing by zero. We can avoid this by using [the `COALESCE` function](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/conditional_expressions#coalesce).

* The [`COUNTIF` function](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/functions-and-operators#countif) is used multiple times hereâ€”it can be helpful in situations where you want to maintain separate counts for different conditionals without using `COUNT` and lots of separate subqueries.
