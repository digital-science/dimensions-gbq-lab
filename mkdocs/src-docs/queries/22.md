# 22. Incoming citations for a single publication, by journal

!!! info "Level: Medium"
    This query requires basic knowledge of SQL and the Dimensions data model

## Description

This query counts incoming citations for a single publication. 

Results are grouped by journal, and include the publisher of each journal in the list. 

The [`publications` table](https://docs.dimensions.ai/bigquery/datasource-publications.html) has a `citations` field that includes the publication IDs of all incoming citations for a given paper. We fetch that list in the `citing` subquery below, then query the `publications` table for information about all the IDs in that list.

The `COALESCE` function is used here to minimize the number of null fields in the final results—if an incoming citation is published in a book rather than a journal, for example, then the `journal.title` field will be `NULL`, and the `boook_title.preferred` field is likely to have the value we want. Occasionally, the `publisher` field is unavailable, so we use `COALESCE(p.publisher.name, "(unknown)")` to make sure there aren't any blank fields.

!!! note "Note"
    The list of citing publications is determined by the clause `WHERE p.id='pub.1113640622'`. This can be changed to be as broad or narrow as you wish—changing it to something like `WHERE journal.title='eLife'`, for example, would return incoming citations to an entire journal rather than a single paper.

## Query

```sql
WITH citing AS (
    SELECT citing_pubs.id
    FROM `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications` p
    CROSS JOIN UNNEST(citations) AS citing_pubs
    WHERE p.id='pub.1113640622' -- publication of interest here
)

SELECT
    COALESCE(
        p.journal.title,
        CONCAT(p.book_title.preferred, ' (book)'),
        p.proceedings_title.preferred,
        CONCAT(p.title.preferred, ' (book)') -- some books have this field instead of book_title
    ) AS journal,
	COALESCE(p.publisher.name, "(unknown)") AS publisher,
    p.type AS pubtype, COUNT(p.id) AS citations
FROM `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications` p
WHERE p.id IN (SELECT id FROM citing)
GROUP BY 1,2,3
ORDER BY 4 DESC
```
