# 23. Citing authors by country

!!! info "Level: Medium"
    This query requires basic knowledge of SQL and the Dimensions data model

## Description

This query counts incoming citations for a single publication. The final results count *authors*, rather than publications, and group counts by the country of each author's current affiliation. 

The strategy is similar to [query 22](22.md), which groups citations by journal: the [`publications` table](https://docs.dimensions.ai/bigquery/datasource-publications.html) has a `citations` field that includes the publication IDs of all incoming citations for a given paper. We fetch that list in the `citing` subquery below, then query the `publications` table to get a list of authors for all the publications citing the paper of interest. We join the `researchers` table to get each author's current affiliation. In the final query, we use the `grid` table to associate each author affiliation to a single *country*, then group all results by those countries.

!!! note "Note"
    The list of citing publications is determined by the clause `WHERE p.id='pub.1113640622'`. This can be changed to be as broad or narrow as you wishâ€”changing it to something like `WHERE journal.title='eLife'`, for example, would return incoming citations to an entire journal rather than a single paper.

## Query

```sql
WITH citing AS (
    SELECT citing_pubs.id
    FROM `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications` p
    CROSS JOIN UNNEST(citations) AS citing_pubs
    WHERE p.id='pub.1113640622' -- publication of interest
),
people_and_grids as (
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT auth.researcher_id) AS people,
    res.current_research_org AS gridid
  FROM `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications` pubs
  CROSS JOIN UNNEST(authors) as auth
  INNER JOIN `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.researchers` res
    ON res.id=auth.researcher_id
  WHERE pubs.id IN (SELECT id FROM citing)
  GROUP BY gridid
)

SELECT people, address.country
FROM people_and_grids
INNER JOIN `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.grid` gridinfo
  ON gridinfo.id=people_and_grids.gridid
ORDER BY people DESC
```
