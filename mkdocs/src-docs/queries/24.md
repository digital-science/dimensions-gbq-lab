# 24. Organizations and sub-organizations

!!! info "Level: Medium"
    This query requires basic knowledge of SQL and the Dimensions data model

## Description

This query shows how to extract information about a GRID organization together with all of its sub-organizations. 

Many organizations in the GRID database include parent-child relationships. For example, [grid.495456.f](https://grid.ac/institutes/grid.495456.f) (the *United States Department of the Air Force* page) has both parent and children institutions, so one can use the hierarchy when querying related data e.g. the total number of publications for each of these organizations. 

The query below shows how to leverage the `organization_recursive_child_ids` field in the `grid` table in order to achieve that. This field is prepopulated with all children institutions GRID IDs (recursively), hence it makes it easier to run this type of analyses. 


## Query

```sql
WITH hierarchy AS (

  SELECT
    g.id AS parent,
    g.name AS parent_name,
    children,
    g2.name AS children_name,
  FROM
    `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.grid` g
  CROSS JOIN
    UNNEST(organization_recursive_child_ids) AS children
  INNER JOIN
    `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.grid` g2
  ON
    g2.id = children 
  WHERE
    g.id="grid.495456.f" -- United States Department of the Air Force

)

SELECT
  hierarchy.*,
  COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) as pubs
FROM
  hierarchy 
INNER JOIN
  `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications` p
  on hierarchy.children in UNNEST(p.research_orgs)
GROUP by 1, 2, 3, 4
```


### Breaking it down

The key part of the query uses a `CROSS JOIN` on the `organization_recursive_child_ids` field to retrieve all the descendants of the chosen organization:

```sql
SELECT
  g.id AS parent,
  children,
FROM
  `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.grid` g
CROSS JOIN
  UNNEST(organization_recursive_child_ids) AS children
WHERE
  g.id="grid.495456.f"

```

Furthermore, in order to get more organization metadata e.g. the name, an inner self-join is introduced: 

```sql
SELECT
  g.id AS parent,
  g.name AS parent_name,
  children,
  g2.name AS children_name,
FROM
  `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.grid` g
CROSS JOIN
  UNNEST(organization_recursive_child_ids) AS children
INNER JOIN
  `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.grid` g2
ON
  g2.id = children 
WHERE
  g.id="grid.495456.f" 

```

The final step is to join also the `publications` table, so to get the total publications count for each organization. 

```sql

WITH hierarchy AS (
  -- the grid query above
)

SELECT
  hierarchy.*,
  COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) as pubs
FROM
  hierarchy 
INNER JOIN
  `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications` p
  on hierarchy.children in UNNEST(p.research_orgs)
GROUP by 1, 2, 3, 4
```
