# 26. Field Citation Ratio (FCR) median average

!!! info "Level: Medium"
    This query requires basic knowledge of SQL and the Dimensions data model


## Description

The Field Citation Ratio (FCR) indicates the relative citation performance of an article, when compared to similarly-aged articles in its Fields of Research subject area. 

This query calculates the Field Citation Ratio (FCR) mean per year for publications from a chosen country (eg `'CA'`). FCR Mean is the average Field Citation Ratio (FCR), which indicates the relative citation performance of an article, when compared to similarly-aged articles in its Fields of Research (FoR) category. 

To calculate the geometric mean, we use the following approach, as documented in [Thelwall & Fairclough (2015)](https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013282544):

* For a set of documents, all citation counts are incremented by 1.
* We calculate the natural log of the citations counts.
* We add these values together, and divide by the number of documents.
* We calculate the exponential of this value (reversing the log effect).
* We reduce the final value by 1.

For more background, see this article: [What is the FCR? How is it calculated?](https://plus.dimensions.ai/support/solutions/articles/23000018848-what-is-the-fcr-how-is-it-calculated-).


!!! note "Note"
    The equivalent Dimensions API query is:
    ```
    search publications
    where research_org_countries = "CA"
    return year aggregate fcr_gavg
    sort by fcr_gavg
    ```



## Query

```sql
SELECT
  year,
  COUNT(*) AS pub_count,
  (EXP(AVG(LN(metrics.field_citation_ratio + 1))) - 1) AS fcr_gavg
FROM
  `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications` AS p
WHERE
  'CA' IN UNNEST(research_org_countries)
  AND year >= 2000
  AND year <= 2019
GROUP BY
  year
ORDER BY
  year DESC
```
