# 28. Researcher collaborations

!!! info "Level: Medium"
    This query requires basic knowledge of SQL and the Dimensions data model


## Description

This query generates two-author pairs and counts how many publications are shared between them. The `WHERE` clause can be used to define a subset of the Dimensions publication dataset to examine—without that, the query will generate co-authorship counts for every author of all 120+ million publications.

!!! note
    Each two-author pair will have *two* entries in the results: One for `(Researcher 1, Researcher 2)` and another for `(Researcher 2, Researcher 1)`. If you want to prevent duplicates, adding something like `WHERE researcher1_id > researcher2_id` will arbitrarily pick one of the combinations to display.

## Query

```sql

  ,CONCAT(r1.first_name, " ", r1.last_name) AS researcher1
  ,g1.name AS researcher1_org
  ,CONCAT(r2.first_name, " ", r2.last_name) AS researcher2
  ,g2.name AS researcher2_org
  ,COUNT(p.id) AS collaborations
