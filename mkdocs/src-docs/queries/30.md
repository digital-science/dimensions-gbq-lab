# 30. Publication volume growth rate

!!! warning "Level: Advanced"
    This query requires a good understanding of SQL and the Dimensions data model


## Description

This query calculates the growth rate of the number of publications in a particular field over time. Using annual numbers can make visualizations almost impossible to read, since year-to-year numbers can be noisy and include large swings in either direction. To avoid this, the query below uses a **sliding five-year window**: For example, the publication count for 2005 would include *all of the publications between 2001 and 2005*.

The other way the results are smoothed is in our choice of comparison: Rather than comparing the 2005 total to the 2004 total, **we compare 2005 to the previous 5-year window, which ended in 2000**. Both of these strategies can be adjusted in the query:

* To adjust the "width" of the window, modify the line that says `5 PRECEDING` to whatever number of years works best for your data.
* To adjust which windows are compared to get the growth rate, adjust the line that says `LAG(running_total, 5)` by changing the `5` to a different value. For example, a `5` here means we compare the 2005 total to the 2000 total, but, changing this to `LAG(running_total, 1)` would compare 2005 to *2004*.


## Query

```sql
WITH pub_counts AS (
  SELECT
    p.year, COUNT(p.id) AS num
  FROM `dimensions-ai.data_analytics.publications` p
  WHERE
    ---- HERE is where to define your publications
    ---- of interest
    p.year >= 1990
    AND '2101' IN UNNEST(p.category_for.second_level.codes) -- Archaeology
  GROUP BY 1
),
pub_window AS (
    SELECT year, num
      ,SUM(num) OVER(ORDER BY year ROWS BETWEEN 5 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total
    FROM pub_counts
),
pub_collate AS (
    SELECT year, num, running_total
        ,LAG(running_total, 5) OVER(ORDER BY year ASC) AS prev_total
    FROM pub_window
)

SELECT year
    ,num AS pub_count
    ,((running_total - prev_total) / prev_total) AS rate
FROM pub_collate
WHERE year >= (SELECT MIN(year) FROM pub_counts)+10
ORDER BY 1 ASC
```
