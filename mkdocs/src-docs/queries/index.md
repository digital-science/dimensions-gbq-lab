# About Queries

The Queries section is an archive of reusable SQL queries together with an explanation of how they work. 

You can navigate these contents sequentially, or simply use the search box at the top to find items of interest. Alternatively, you can find thematic groups of queries in the [Collections](../collections/index.md) section.



!!! note 
    The Google BigQuery [official documentation website](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax) provides in-depth tutorials about SQL syntax.
